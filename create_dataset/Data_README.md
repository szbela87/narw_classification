## Creating the data files

The origional dataset is available at [timeseriesclassification.com](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=RightWhaleCalls). 

The dataset includes 10,934 instances for training and 1,962 instances for testing. Each instance is a two-second audio segment sampled at a rate of 2 kHz, resulting in a series length 4000. The dataset was subdivided into training, validation, and testing sets with proportions of 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively.

To create the `.csv` files just run the 'load_data.ipynb' file.
